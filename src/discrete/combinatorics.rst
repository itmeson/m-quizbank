:summary: A collection of assessment questions on combinatorics
:tags: DC.2.A,DC.2.B


Suppose there are 10 different names written on slips of paper in a hat.

If you draw out one at a time, writing down the names as you go, how many different listings of names could you possibly get:

   1. If you draw all 10 names.
   2. If you only draw 2 names.
   3. If you draw out 7 names.


Now suppose you keep the slips of paper as you draw them out, and after you are finished drawing out of the hat, you write down the names in alphabetical order.  How many different lists could  you possibly get:

   1. If you draw all 10 names.
   2. If you only draw 2 names.
   3. If you draw out 7 names.
 

Now suppose you put the slips of paper back into the hat after each time you draw them out, and you write the names down in order as you draw them out (as in the first problem).  How many different lists could you possibly get:

   1. If you draw out 10 names.
   2. If you only draw 2 names.
   3. If you draw out 7 names

 
For each question, write down the calculation that you would perform to get the answer, and explain why that calculation is correct.
